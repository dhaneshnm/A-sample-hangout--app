<p>
We are iSensor research team, and we are from Goodwin College of Professional studies, at Drexel University.  We are asking you to participate in this research study because you are above 18 years of age and you are the best candidate who can give us fruitful feedback on this experiment. This consent form will explain the study to you. Please feel free to ask questions about the research if you have any. We will be happy to explain anything in greater detail if you wish.
This is a study of "trustworthiness attribution" in virtual collaborative environment. Based on a set of social interaction scenarios and the use of online collaboration tools, we study how virtual agents perceive each others' behaviors, and moreover, the coordination stigmergy among groups using computer-mediated communications. We also study how players can implement and detect deceit.
</p>

PURPOSE:     A research study is a way to learn more about people. In this study, we are trying to learn more about "perceived trustworthiness" within the context of an organization. The study also tries to determine links between someone detecting deceit and implementing it.
<br/>
PROCEDURES:     If you decide you want to be part of this study, you will be asked to play a series of simple games, demonstrate logical thinking skills, and give us your observations, comments and perceptions about a scenario. All of this together should take about 10 to 30 minutes. At the end of these games, you will be debriefed individually about what each step in the process of participating in the game signifies and how the data would be utilized in our research.
<br/>
RISKS: There are some things about this study you should know. You will work individually, exercise your problem-solving skills, and experience. It is expected of you to not give out the content of the games to anyone. Any such action will only lead to removing your name from the benefits pool which is used to decide the winners. The end of the game-playing will conclude with a debriefing that reiterates the purpose and scope of the research. All interview materials, including digital-recordings and text-based files, will be locked in our research-related cabinets and databases, and will be analyzed and reported as basis for our empirical findings for the purpose of academic publications. There is "some" risk of identity disclosure since we require the email address from the subject which will be used to distribute prizes if the subject wins. All identifiable data will be destroyed when the study is complete. You may withdraw from the study at any time by sending an e-mail from the account which was used to play the game to intel.sensor@gmail.com.
<br/>
BENEFITS: 
Not everyone who takes part in this study will benefit directly. We will have a pool of winner for the games that will be played online. An assessment committee will decide the winners to games 1 and 2, and the winners would be awarded gift certificates. Game 3 winners are solely based on percentage of correct answers; no outside judging will occur for it. Though not everyone will receive a direct prize, we think indirect benefits might be applied that you will learn to analyze scenarios better and that you will exercise your mind to solve problems. 
<br/>
PAYMENTS: 
The top players of each game will be awarded prizes. 
<br/>
ALTERNATIVES:     Involvement in the study is voluntary, so you may choose to participate or not. If you do not want to be in this research study, you can let us know and cancel your access to our Facebook Application.
<br/>
REPORTS:     When we are finished with this study, we will write a report about what was learned.  This report will NOT include your real identity, or not mention any of your personal details. All information will be kept anonymous and confidential so data collection does not allow responses to be connected with a particular subject.
<br/>
VOLUNTARY:	     Your participation is voluntary and you may refuse to participate and withdraw from the study at this time without penalty. If you decide to stop after we begin, that's okay too. You may withdraw from the study at any time by sending an e-mail from the account which was used to play the game to intel.sensor@gmail.com .
<br/>
QUESTIONS:     You can ask questions now or whenever you wish. If you have questions concerning this study (including this experiment and interview), you may email or call us.
